We will continue using the data set from the previous section to introduce some basics of data visualization. Some libraries can include data sets that once you install the library you can use. In this case we will use data from the `STNet` library, if you dont have it installed yet make sure you do by using:

```{r eval = F}
# Install STNet from github
devtools::install_github('spablotemporal/STNet')
```


```{r}
# Load the libraries
library(ggplot2) # for graphics
library(dplyr) # For data manipulation
library(STNet)

# loading the data from the package
farms <- STNet::SwineFarms
PRRS <- STNet::PRRS
mov <- STNet::SwineMov
```

# Plots in R

By default R already has a set of functions to create a variety of figures, but the code can get quite complex and difficult to read as we produce more detailed figures. `ggplot2` is a library that provides a set of functions for producing a variety of figures.

The basic components that we need to define for a plot are the following:
  
  - *data*, the data set we will use to generate the figure
  - *geometry*, or type of graphic we will generate (i.e. histogram, bar, scatter, etc..)
  - *aesthetic*, variables or arguments that will be used for the figure for example: location, color, size, etc..

An example:

```{r hist example}
ggplot(data = PRRS) + # This is the data we will use
  geom_histogram( # This is the geometry 
    aes(x = Age) # The aesthetic includes only one variable representing the x axis
  )
```

Other components of the plots can be defined to further customize our figures, and we will cover those more in detail in future sections.  
As you noticed in the previous example, we can print the figures directly from the R console, but a way I like to organize our figures is to put them all inside a single object in R. This object can be a `list`, which is just a container for other objects.  

```{r create fig list}
# To create an empty list we can use the function list()
figures <- list()
```



# Visualizing distributions

## Continous variables

### Histograms

The most simple way to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable is using a histogram. Histograms are a special kind of bar plots where our variable is grouped in bins and showing the counts for each bin. Now that we have our container list for the plots, we can simply save it there and assign a name we want.

```{r hist}
figures$histogram <- PRRS %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Age))

# we can see our plot by calling the name in our container list
figures$histogram
```


### Boxplots

Box plots are great to show the distribution of a continuous variable. We can use it to show only one variable, or multiple variables. It is important to be very descriptive when making plots, the idea of a figure is that can explain itself. we will start to slowly introduce functions to do this and customize our figures.

```{r boxplot}
# Only one variable
figures$box <- PRRS %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = Age)) +
  labs(title = 'Distribution of Age') # we can add different labels such as the main title

figures$box
```


## Frequencies (Barplots, bubbles, mozaics, Pie charts)

### Barplots

```{r barplots}
figures$bars <- PRRS %>% 
  count(farm_type) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(
    x = farm_type, # X axis
    y = n # Y axis
  ), stat = 'identity') # type of barplot

figures$bars
```

# Visualizing relationships

## Scatterplots

This is one of the most popular kind of plots, it is useful to represent relationship between two continuous variables.  
We can achieve the same result in different ways. The first one is better when we have our variables in the same dataset, and the second one when we have data from different objects. (the length of the two vectors has to be the same).  

```{r}
figures$scatter <- farms %>% # first we start with the name of our data.frame
  ggplot() + # then we call ggplot
  geom_point(aes(x = outgoing, y = incoming)) # and we add layer for points

figures$scatter
```


# Time series

To create a time series we will need to reformat the data a little bit so R can do what we want. We will introduce a new kind of variable: `date`. The date variables are pretty much what it sounds like, is a variable that has a format with year, month and day; there are other ways to format dates in R, but this is the most common and straight forward.  

```{r}
mov <- mov %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, "%m/%d/%y"), # First we will format the date
         week = format(date, "%V"),
         week = lubridate::floor_date(date, 'week')) # The we create a variable formatting the date as week of the year
```

Now that we have our variables in the correct format, we can use it as any other variable.

```{r}
figures$timeseries <- mov %>% 
  count(week) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = n))

figures$timeseries
```

# Arranging the plots in a layout

Now that we have all the figures in a list, we can make arrangements with our figures. For this we use the function `ggarrange()` from the ggpubr library.  

```{r}
library(ggpubr) # load the library
ggarrange(plotlist = figures)
```

# Further customization

## Labels

Usually we try to avoid spaces when using names for the column names, but for our plots this could be not the most straight forward way to communicate our analysis, we can set specific labels to make our plots more readable and self explanatory. Let's improve bar plot figure a bit more to make it clearer:

```{r}
figures$bars <- PRRS %>% 
  count(farm_type) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = farm_type, y = n), stat = 'identity') + # type of barplot
  labs(# We will use the function labs to generate our labels
    title = 'Number of farms by type',
    x = 'Farm type',
    y = 'Number of farms'
  )

figures$bars
```

## Themes

ggplot includes the function `theme()` to define most of the aspects of the figure such as the background color, the grid, axes, legend, among many others. There is also several predefined themes (all start with `theme_` followed by the name of the theme) that you can use, if don't want to mess with all the arguments from the function `theme()`. For example:

```{r}
# all the predefined themes start with theme_
figures$timeseries <- mov %>% 
  count(week) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = n)) +
  theme_minimal() # We will use the theme minimal

figures$timeseries
```

## Other aesthetics

### Shape

There are other aesthetics we can define such as color, type of point, size, among many others. Lets try changing the point shape for one of the plots we previously did:

```{r}
figures$scatter <- farms %>% # the data we are using
  ggplot() + # we call ggplot
  geom_point(aes(
    x = outgoing, # X axis
    y = incoming, # Y axis
    shape = farm_type # point shape
  )) +
  labs(title = 'Movements by farm') +
  theme_classic() # now lets try the theme 'classic'

figures$scatter
```

### Color

In the next example we will use the Sex of the animal to color our boxplot:

```{r fill}
PRRS %>% 
  ggplot() + # we call ggplot
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = Age, fill = Sex)) # we add a boxplot layer
```

We can also use the variable to color other parts of the plot such as the border:

```{r col}
PRRS %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = Age, col = Sex))
```

### Non aesthetics customization

So far we have added variables inside our `aes()` function, but we can add some arguments outside the `aes()` function that we want them to be applied for all observations. For example, we can change the outline of the boxplot to be the same for the two groups, but the fill color different per group:

```{r}
PRRS %>% 
  ggplot() + # we call ggplot
  geom_boxplot(
    aes(y = Age, fill = Sex), # This is the normal aesthetics we define
    col = 'red' # all aesthetics we define here will be applied to all th ebservations
  ) # we add a boxplot layer
```

## Colors

To define specific colors for our figure, we can use the function `scale_*_manual` where the * represents the aesthetic we want to represent. If we want to use the color for the fill, we would use:

```{r colors}
figures$box <- PRRS %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = Age, fill = Sex)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('red', 'green'))

figures$box
```


R manages colors in three different ways: by name (i.e: 'red'), by rgb value using the function `rgb()` (i.e. `rgb(1, 0, 0)`), or using [hexadecimal code](https://marketing.istockphoto.com/blog/hex-colors-guide/) (i.e. "#F00000"). You can get a full list of the named colors in R by using the function `colors()`, but you will only be able to see the names. Luckly someone made a tool that can help us exacly the colors that we want: the *Colour Picker* addin. Addins are tools that are available in Rstudio to facilitate tasks, lets try the colour picker (should be already in your addins toolbar).

![](img/1c_colPicker.gif)

**Exercise: ** Pick two colors you like and use them to create a boxplot of the distribution of age by the test result.

```{r include = F}
PRRS %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = Age, fill = Result), col = 'grey20') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('red4', 'blue4'))
```


# Facets

Facets are a way of stratifying the data based on variables in the data set, you can think about it in a similar way we have been using groups. To create a stratified plot we can use the function `facet_grid()` which will ask for a variable to go in the rows and another for columns:

```{r}
figures$histogram <- PRRS %>% # The data we will use 
  ggplot() + # we call ggplot
  geom_histogram(aes(Age)) + # We will create a histogram of the Age
  facet_grid(
    rows = vars(Sex), # We will use the Sex variable for rows
    cols = vars(Result) # We use the Result variable for Columns
  ) +
  theme_linedraw() # lets try another theme

figures$histogram
```

# Exporting plots

Now that we have a good mix of different figures, lets export them. We can use the function `ggsave()` to export a high definition figure. 

```{r}
ggsave(figures$histogram, filename = 'myHistogram.png')
```

## More customization

You can create more detailed arrangements of figures like i will show in the following example:

```{r}
ggarrange( # Funciton to arrange the figures
  figures$box, figures$scatter, figures$bars, figures$timeseries, # These are the figures I will arrange
  heights = c(5, 3), # We can define the heights for each of the rows
  labels = c("A","B", "C", "D") # add a label for each figure
) %>% 
  annotate_figure( # Function to annotate the figure
    top = text_grob( # Top title
      label = 'Distribution of the data', # Label for title
      face = 'bold', # Bold letters
      size = 18 # Size of the title
    )
  )
```

# Interactive figures

Having static figures is the most common application of graphics in R, but R is also capable of making interactive figures that can be used in dashboards and other platforms (i.e. shiny, or quarto). There are several libraries that allow you to create interactive figures, one of the most popular ones is called `plotly`. The best part of plotly is that if you learn how to use ggplot, you can transfer your figures to interactive plotly figures pretty much seamesly. Lets try that.  

We use the function `ggplotly()` from the `plotly` library to do that:

```{r}
library(plotly) # laod the plotly library
# Use the ggplotly function in one of the figures we previouslt created:
ggplotly(figures$histogram)
```


# Other type of figures

Here we did not covered all the different visualization tools available in R, there are several other type of figures you can do. A good resource for this is the https://r-graph-gallery.com. this is a website that has multiple categories of figures and code to reproduce them all. Let's take some time to explore the different types of visualizations available. Go to the website and explore on your own for a little bit.
